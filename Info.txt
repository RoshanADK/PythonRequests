Just did it for fun . I am a bit lazy type of person . So I kinda wanted to do everything just using Terminal .
Anyway Python has never disappointed me . It has always been a fun to learn python stuffs !

Run the script Cricbuzz.py and it will give you current cricket love scores ! Just configure and get it in your Terminal .

Run SandP.py to get current Standards and Poor 500 Index !

Run Temperature.py to get current Temperature status !

Run Stock_Gain.py to obtain Stock markets information !

:) :) Enjoy Python :) :)
